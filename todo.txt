Halo 3 Custom Edition To-Do List
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Check if user is in a lobby and load directly into that lobby
2. Pull player armor colors and display them in-lobby
3. Finish controller support and add Playstation layout (DO THIS SOON)
4. Rebuild the changeMenu function to be less messy and bloated
5. Work on Halo 2 and 3 CSS (Low priority)
6. Move helper functions to dewHelper.js file
7. Add more server browser filters like ping, location, etc.
8. Optimize network functions to help performance, maybe offload to a separate server? (Orion's VPS or ERIQ.CO server)
9. Cleaup and further optimize current code
10. Compress videos more or work out better loading method to help bandwidth and load times
11. Finish loading screen
12. Remake settings to be less bloated and messy (Add return variable, remove changing text from update functions)
13. Add spartan customization (How do we show armor?)
14. Get player stats showing and working correctly in lobbies
15. Add keyboard navigation, piggyback off of gamepad functions with Mousetrap.js
16. Add controls to bottom of menu like Reach
17. Remove unused code
18. Take suggestions from people in IRC for more additions/improvements/bug fixes
19. Make music shuffle through each game
20. Intergrate in-game chat
21. Don't load into game if in browser


Add any suggestions or things I may have missed to this list.
